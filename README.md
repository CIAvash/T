T - An easy way of writing test assertions which output good test descriptions and error messages

DESCRIPTION
===========

T is a [Raku](https://www.raku-lang.ir/en/) module for writing test
assertions which output good test descriptions and error messages.

It provides the `t` keyword for writing test assertions which takes an expression of form `<got> <infix> <expected>`.

Goals of the module:
- Write less but more readable test code
- Get a useful test description and failure message

use T:auth<zef:CIAash>;

t 4 == 4;
=output ok 1 - 4 == 4

t $my_great_module.return('something') eq 'something';
=output ok 2 - $my_great_module.return('something') eq 'something'

t $my_great_module.return('something else') eq 'something';
=output not ok 3 - $my_great_module.return('something else') eq 'something'
# Failed test '$my_great_module.return('something else') eq 'something''
# at ... line ...
# expected: "something"
#  matcher: 'infix:<eq>'
#      got: "something else"
```
